### Interest
I feel like this article is interesting because it demonstrates how tech companies are increasingly switching to remote work as many have realized that work-from-home offers an increase in productivity and happiness. The article also touches upon the kinds of remote technologies and tools employees will require, and how they can be combined with in-person tools and technologies so as to ensure increaased productivity and efficient virtual collaboration. This also makes us explore the collaboration tools we would need to work with remote developers; including code management, task management and application performance monitoring tools.
